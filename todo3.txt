todo3

UI ideas
	you focus on a firm or resource and it opens it
		flavor on bottom
			quote marks, light text, italic
		displays details such as price etc
		focused item has light blue bottom border
	splitting the entire thing into just player and economoy as a whole, just 2 parts
	adding trading to resources, making it a modal instead of separate tab
	click on season for modal about it as well
	work on mobile display more too

Fix bugs
	minor bugs:
		chart.js can't handle if a resource doesn't have a price (ie. nothing that produces it exists)

Trading overhaul
	implementing order object system

Adding player
should first implement trading overhaul
	they set buy and sell and their firms run as normal, option to buy a new firm for their expand costs

add locations
	oh boy
