todo3

UI ideas
	you focus on a firm or resource and it opens it
		flavor on bottom
			quote marks, light text, italic
		displays details such as price etc
		focused item has light blue bottom border
	splitting the entire thing into just player and economoy as a whole, just 2 parts
	adding trading to resources, making it a modal instead of separate tab
	click on season for modal about it as well
	work on mobile display more too
	display economy basics such as prices etc on stock ticker on top
	every firm has a little round box that displays how much it's buying, for what cost, and how much it's selling, for what cost
	clicking on firm shows all the stats (constants like number of what it produces and takes in)

Economy improvements
	fix getBuyOrders for CPUs so it takes more info into account, like in previous buy and trade scripts
	for example, upkeep, expansion, etc

Misc
	inventory class? with inventory subtraction and comparison capabilities built in

Fix bugs
	minor bugs:
		chart.js can't handle if a resource doesn't have a price (ie. nothing that produces it exists)

minor improvements
	chart is redrawn once a checkbox is changed

Adding player
should first implement trading overhaul
	they set buy and sell and their firms run as normal, option to buy a new firm for their expand costs
	need input verification on buy and sell inputs, better UI for what they're buying and selling, history, and more options
	need to verify that they have the resources ot place that order
	DONE: need better visual feedback that the buy order is active when the switch is off


// notes for player orders:
// trade input switch should clear only after order completion, not just after order is placed (orders are cleared)
// subtract from order and update input with value remaining to order?
// option to order for next X days instead of 1 or forever
history display in modal, with sort by most/least recent, order type, displaying icons, etc, and clear history option
display total history of resource gained and sold, and money spent/gained

add locations
	oh boy
