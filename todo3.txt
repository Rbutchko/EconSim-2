UI ideas
	you focus on a firm or resource and it opens it
		flavor on bottom
			quote marks, light text, italic
		displays details such as price etc
		focused item has light blue bottom border
	splitting the entire thing into just player and economoy as a whole, just 2 parts
	adding trading to resources, making it a modal instead of separate tab
	work on mobile display more too
