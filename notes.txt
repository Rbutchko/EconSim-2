Mint:
The mint class actually isn't special. It will just not sell anything
I imagine this working as each coin being individually molded metal like a piece of art, with
very fine artwork making it valuable. Therefore, it will require metal and a large amount of food

todo: organize below stuff:


// let buyIdxs = [...Array(currentBuys.length).keys()]; // list of nums 0 to n-1
// shuffle(buyIdxs);
		
this.sell[sellResource] += Math.round(factor + 1); //maybe instead of + 1, it should be factor * 10% of price, or if price is 1, factor + 1?

if(ticks % TRADE_INTERVAL == 0) { //Can introduce sharding here by changing this to be a constant set in each firm, also change so firm inherits that as well as sell price

function productionStrat(firm) { // and the firm would also be an argument
	switch(firm.productionOrder) {
		case 'on':
			// console.log('here a firm would act normally but not check to reproduce or do trading');
			firm.productionOrder = 'on';
			break;

		case 'off':
			// firm will do nothing and not pay upkeep
			// console.log('firm would do nothing');
			firm.productionOrder = 'off';
			break;

		default: // why isn't this recognising null when I call it with that argument in the paramater
			firm.productionOrder = 'auto';
			// console.log('This firm is an AI ' +  firm.productionOrder);
			// console.log('This firm is an AI, so it would follow all AI procedures. here we would call doProduction and trade and upkeep etc.');

		/* we could also semi-easily create a case where a firm does half its production for like .6 * the resources,
		or potentially produce more output for higher input costs (again loosing efficency). that would simulate a real life production curve*/
